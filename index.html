                White shirt, now red, my bloody nose
                Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
                Creepin' around like no one knows
                Think you're so criminal
                Bruises on both my knees for you
                Don't say thank you or please
                I do what I want when I'm wanting to
                My soul? so cynical
                </p>
                <p class="song-text">[Chorus]
                So you're a tough guy
                Like it really rough guy
                Just can't get enough guy
                Chest always so puffed guy
                I'm that bad type
                Make your mama sad type
                Make your girlfriend mad tight
                Might seduce your dad type
                I'm the bad guy, duh
                </p>
                <p class="song-text">[Verse 2]
                I like it when you take control
                Even if you know that you don't
                Own me, I'll let you play the role
                I'll be your animal
                My mommy likes to sing along with me
                But she won't sing the song
                If she reads all the lyrics
                She'll pity the men I know
                </p>
                <p class="song-text">[Chorus]
                So you're a tough guy
                Like it really rough guy
                Just can't get enough guy
                Chest always so puffed guy
                I'm that bad type
                Make your mama sad type
                Make your girlfriend mad tight
                Might seduce your dad type
                I'm the bad guy, duh
                </p>
                <p class="song-text">[Post-Chorus]
                I'm the bad guy, duh
                I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
                [Interlude]
                I like when you get mad
                I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
                You said she's scared of me?
                I mean, I don't see what she sees
                But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
                </p>
                <p class="song-text">[Outro]
                I'm a bad guy
                I'm a bad guy
                Bad guy, bad guy
                I'm a bad
                </p>
